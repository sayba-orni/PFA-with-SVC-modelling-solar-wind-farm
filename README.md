# modelling-SVC-RES
The integration of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, into power systems has
brought forth challenges in power flow control. This project explores the impact of renewables
on power flow control and investigates the performance of Flexible AC Transmission Systems
(FACTS) devices such as Static VAR Compensators (SVC) managing power flow. For analyzing
the SVC, variable susceptance model is used and incorporated in the Newton Raphson load flow
algorithm. It discusses the efficacy of SVC devices in controlling and transferring bulk power
over long distances. The analysis evaluates the performance of SVC in various aspects including
reactive power injection, real power flow, power loss reduction, and voltage improvement.
Furthermore, the modeling of solar and wind farms employing distribution functions is
discussed. We used the beta distribution function to forecast the anticipated output power of
solar farms and the Weibull distribution function for wind farms. In both instances, our modeling
approach relied on historical data to inform the distribution functions. This methodological
choice allowed us for a more accurate representation of the expected power generation from
these renewable energy sources. The effect of adding renewable energy sources on a power
system is studied. All the analysis is done using MATLAB and through Newton Raphson power
flow analysis algorithm. Numerical results are presented on a standard IEEE 5-bus test system.
